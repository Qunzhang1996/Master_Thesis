Metadata for provided data sets
---------------------------------
Implementation notes: 
To speed up the RL training it is suitable to create scenarios that force many lane changes
This is done by creating some vehicle with significantly lower speed.
This means that these vehicles will quickly be far away from the ego vehicle and essentially become uninteresting to the agent
To avoid this and further force lane changes, vehicles that are a certain distance behind the ego vehicle will "respawn" ahead in traffic
This should not impact the result as the respawn distance (+-120m) is further than what might be considered for the truck GNN, 
but worth to keep in mind when e.g, validating 1-step ahead predictions of the respawning vehicles

Its also possible to alter this distance and even turn of respawning in the simulation loop 

General
------
Data is provided in a (N_x,Nveh*N_sim) matrix
 - Splitting this into (N_x,Nveh,N_sim) tensor seems suitable

class encoding: [0,1,2,3] = [truck,passive,normal,aggressive]

Data is provided in a minimal state representation
x = [x-position,y-position,x-velocity,steering angle,class]

This dataset
--------------
N_x  = 5  (Number of vehicle features)
Nveh = 6 (Number of vehicles in simulation)
N_sim = 1000 (Number of samples in time)
dt_sim = 0.2 (Simulation time steps (sec))
dt_ctrl = 1 (Controler decision time steps (sec) )
